**McGill University, Fall 2016** &mdash; Derek Nowrouzezahrai<br />
[Course Website][website]

This class explores the technical details behind image synthesis techniques used for realistic visual effects in modern feature films, games, and architectural & product visualizations. Starting with the fundamentals of radiometry, the study and measurement of electromagnetic radiation (like visible light), we present mathematical models of how light propagates in an environment to eventually form an image on a sensor (e.g., a camera's film or the human eye).
